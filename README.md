# Assignment Tracker

This is a simple assignment tracker project I built to practice my frontend skills. Built using React + Typescript + Tailwind CSS. The information input by the user is fetched and stored into localStorage so that it is remembered even after the webpage is closed.

These are the basic features: 

- Add and delete assignments
- Assign colors to every course for better visual separation
- Filter based on courses, priority, status, and days left
- Assignments and course colors stored in localStorage so that they persist even after reload / page close
